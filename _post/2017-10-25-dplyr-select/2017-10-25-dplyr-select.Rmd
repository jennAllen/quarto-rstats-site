Some of my friends didn't aware that dplyr now accepts characters. Did you?

For example, this expression


```r
select(iris, Sepal.Length, Petal.Length)
```

can be also written in this way:


```r
select(iris, "Sepal.Length", "Petal.Length")
```

or in this way:


```r
select(iris, c("Sepal.Length", "Petal.Length"))
```

For the semantics of `select()`, you can find a good explanation in [the vignette](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dplyr.html#selecting-operations).

## Tidyeval?

You may want to write some code that selects columns programmatically using variables.


```r
x <- c("col1", "col2")
select(some_data, x)
```

But, be fareful, `x` can be ambiguous.
If `some_data` has a column named `x`, it selects the column `x` instead of `col1` and `col2`, the content of the variable `x`.

To avoid these troubles, you should explicitly unquote `x` by `!!` or `!!!` (both are ok in this case).


```r
x <- c("col1", "col2")
select(some_data, !! x)
```

`rlang::expr()` can show how the expression is unquoted.


```r
x <- c("col1", "col2")

rlang::expr(select(some_data, !! x))
#> select(some_data, c("col1", "col2"))

rlang::expr(select(some_data, !!! x))
#> select(some_data, "col1", "col2")
```
