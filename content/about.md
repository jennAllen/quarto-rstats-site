Hi! I'm Hiroaki Yutani.

This blog is where I struggle to learn about R (and improve my poor English).

My interests are mainly focused on data visualization, data manipulation and web APIs. I maintain several R packages:

* [gghighlight](https://yutannihilation.github.io/gghighlight/): Highlight ggplot with predicates.
* [datadogr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=datadogr): R Client for [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) API
* [kntnr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=kntnr): R Client for [kintone](https://www.kintone.com/) API
* [qiitr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=qiitr): R Interface to [Qiita](http://qiita.com/) API
* [estatapi](https://cran.r-project.org/package=estatapi): R Interface to e-Stat API, the one-stop service for official statistics of the Japanese government
* [kokudosuuchi](https://cran.r-project.org/package=kokudosuuchi): R Interface to Kokudo Suuchi API, the GIS data service of the Japanese government
