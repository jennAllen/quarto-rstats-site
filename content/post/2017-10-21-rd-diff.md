You may notice that diffs of .Rd files are suppressed by default on GitHub since some time.

Do you wonder who did this? It's me, yay! This is my pull request:

[Ignore roxygen2 generated files by yutannihilation · Pull Request #3373 · github/linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/3373)

Though I thought I've done the right thing at that time, now I'm afraid this change may be bad for some cases...

After the relese of roxygen2 6.0.0, the game has changed a bit. We can use Markdown to write package document now.

[roxygen2 6.0.0 | RStudio Blog](https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/02/01/roxygen2-6-0-0/)

The feature itself is so cool (I use it often), but sometimes it behaves against our expectations:

* https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/pull/2801
* https://github.com/tidyverse/purrr/pull/361

Should we stop suppressing the .Rd diffs to review with the eyes? If you think so, please send the revert pull request to [github/linguist]((https://github.com/github/linguist)). But I hope my effort improved the experience of R development on GitHub.
